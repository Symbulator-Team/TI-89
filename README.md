Symbulator for TI-89
=====

Symbulator is a symbolic simulator of linear circuits, widely regarded as the best ever made for a calculator. It can perform DC, AC, transient and frequency domain analyses of symbolic and numeric linear circuits; find the Th√©venin, Norton and two-port equivalent of a network, and do Bode plots. It accepts ideal resistors, independent and dependent current and voltage sources, ideal op amps, capacitors, inductors, mutual inductances, transformers and six types of two-ports.
